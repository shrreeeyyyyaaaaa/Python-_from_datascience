## what is python ? 
Python is a popular and easy-to-use programming language thatâ€™s great for both beginners and experienced developers. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python is known for being simple, readable, and versatile, making it useful for many types of projects.

Hereâ€™s why people love Python:

**Easy to Learn & Read** â€“ Pythonâ€™s code looks almost like plain English, so itâ€™s easier to understand and write.
**No Need to Declare Variable Types** â€“ You can just start using variables without worrying about their type; Python figures it out for you.
**Runs Line by Line**â€“ Python is an interpreted language, meaning you can run and test your code quickly, making debugging easier.
**Flexible Coding Styles** â€“ You can write code in different styles, whether itâ€™s simple step-by-step (procedural), object-based, or functional.
**Comes with a Lot of Built-in Tools** â€“ Python has a huge library of ready-made tools for tasks like handling files, working with data, and building websites.
**Tons of Extra Libraries** â€“ Developers have created tons of free tools to extend Python, such as Django for web apps, Pandas for data analysis, and TensorFlow for AI.
**Works on Any Computer** â€“ Python runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without much hassle.
**Big & Helpful Community** â€“ Since so many people use Python, thereâ€™s plenty of help, tutorials, and forums if you ever get stuck.
